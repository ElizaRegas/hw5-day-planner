## Description 

This day planner was a homework assignment for the Georgia Tech Full Stack Web Development Program. We worked on dynamically generating html via jQuery, we stored information via local storage, and we incorporated momentjs.com to display the current date. We also used momentjs.com to highlight the current hour on the schedule in red, leaving the future time blocks green, and the past time blocks grey.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the index.html file in a default browser.
